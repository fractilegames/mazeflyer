Linux Game Jam 2019: Maze Flyer by FRACTiLE Games
=================================================

Find and destroy all enemy sentry guns in randomly generated maze as fast as possible. Using six-degree-of-freedom controls in zero gravity.

**Controls**

Move left/right: Gamepad left stick X, keyboard A-D  
Move forward/backward: Gamepad left stick Y, keyboard W-S  
Move up/down: Gamepad Square/X-Cross/A, keyboard R-F  
Yaw left/right: Gamepad right stick X, keyboard left-right  
Pitch up/down: Gamepad right stick Y, keyboard up-down  
Roll left/right: Gamepad L2-R2, keyboard Q-E  
Shoot: Gamepad R1, keyboard space  
Abort match: Esc  

**NOTE**: A gamepad is definitely the best way to play the game, but it needs to be a good one. I tested PS3 controller and Logitech F310 gamepad and the hard-coded deadzones on the latter made accurate aiming really hard.

Important stuff I had to cut to make the deadline (I might add some these at some point later on):

- Mouse control (pitch/yaw) and acceleration to keyboard controls.
- Proper menus and completion/failure screens.
- Full-screen mode and resolution switching.
- High-score tables.
- A lot of eye candy (for example particle effects and SSAO).

The game is made on Xubuntu Linux and using mostly open-source tools:

- [Godot Engine 3.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Blender 2.80 beta](https://www.blender.org/)
- [Gimp 2.10](https://www.gimp.org/)
- [Ocenaudio 3.6.1](http://www.ocenaudio.com/) (free, not open-source)
